      <p>Do the films Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar and the trilogy of batman ring a bell? Well-known films that have been beautifully captured and that captivate audiences. Where do these ideas come from? Look inside the head of a successful

        <h2>where it <span>began</span></h2>
      </header>
      <p>Nolan was born in London. He has an English father, Brendan James Nolan and an American mother, Christina. His childhood was split between London and Evanston, Illinois, and he has both British and US citizenship. Like a real English, Christopher
        is a real tea fan. He always has his coat with a flask or tea in it, and he drinks this tea all day long. It is his fuel for creativity and focus. He has an older brother, Matthew Francis Nolan, a convicted criminal, and a younger brother, Jonathan.</p>
      <p>He began making films at age seven, borrowing his father's Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures. Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by Star Wars, and around the age of eight, he made a stop motion animation
        homage called Space Wars. From the age of eleven, he aspired to be a professional filmmaker.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "They're distractions - the noise of the bottles, they're like toys almost, playing around with toys. The lack of chairs, meanwhile keeps you on your toes, literally."

        <p>Christopher Nolan’s partnership and marriage to Emma Thomas is key to his success. While it’s clear that the director’s creative vision comes from within, there’s little doubting Emma’s influence in bringing his dreams to life.</p>

        <p>He always looks sharp on set, wearing a uniform that is said to the difference between the demands of an executive suite and a tundra.” More for the practicality and less for the aesthetic, the director often repeats two outfits for his shooting
          days: one for warmer weather and another for the cold. He decided that.</p>
        <blockquote>
          “it was a waste of energy to choose anew what to wear every day.”

        <h2><span>Old fassion</span> in his ways</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Nolan knows, however, that the natural target of the blockbuster is the lowest common denominator, and he’s had to build into his filmmaking practice personal safeguards against what he calls “chasing an audience.”
      </p>
      <p>In preparation for each film, he spends a week or two bashing out a little précis, on the same typewriter his father gave him when he was 21. Often that précis doesn’t even talk much about the plot; it’s supposed to represent the feeling he wants
        to elicit, the texture of the fable.</p>
      <p>He keeps it in a file and returns to it from time to time to make sure he hasn’t lost touch with his original idea. He also doesn’t do traditional scored research screenings or focus groups, choosing instead to show his films to a handful of people
        at a time as he’s editing.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Phones have become a huge distraction, and people work much better without them. At first it causes difficulty, but it really allows them to concentrate on what they’re doing. Everybody understands. I’ve had a lot of crews thank me. With a set, we’re
        trying to create a bubble of alternate reality.
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nolan says he does not use a mobile phone because it give him time to "think". You can't be texting somebody else and paying attention to what's going on. If you call people on it, they'll repeat the last thing you said. They repeat the words with
        zero understanding of what they meant.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Well, I’ve never used email because I don’t find it would help me with anything I’m doing. I just couldn’t be bothered about it."

        <h2><span>Visual</span> choices</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, dialogue scenes framed in wide close-up with a shallow depth of field, and modern locations and architecture. Nolan has noted that many of his films are heavily influenced
        by film noir.
      </p>
      <p>He has continuously experimented with merging of style and form. Christopher's colour blindness is the most common type as he struggles to distinguish between red and green. Nevertheless, this hasn't prevented the director from writing and directing
        well known films.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. When I talk about reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality."
      </blockquote>
      <p>Nolan has also stressed the importance of establishing a clear point of view in his films, and makes frequent use of "the shot that walks into a room behind a character, because ... that takes the viewer inside the way that the character enters".
        He has also used cinéma-vérité techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism. In an interview at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he explained his emphasis on realism in The Dark Knight trilogy.
      </p>
      <p>And to keep reality as close as possible. Nolan prefers shooting on film to digital video, and opposes the use of digital intermediates and digital cinematography, which he feels are less reliable than film and offer inferior image quality. In particular,
        the director advocates for the use of higher-quality, larger-format film stock such as anamorphic 35 mm, VistaVision, 65 mm, and IMAX. Nolan uses multi-camera for stunts and single-camera for all the dramatic action, from which he then watches
        dailies every night, saying.
      </p>
      <p>On that note is he known to shoot the entirety of his films with one camera, rather than using a second camera for action sequences. That way, Nolan keeps his personality and point of view in every aspect of the film.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Shooting single-camera means I've already seen every frame as it's gone through the gate because my attention isn't divided to multi-cameras.”
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot ... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then why did
        you want to do an action film?
